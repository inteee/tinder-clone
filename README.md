	Tinder Clone - React Native
</h3>

## 🧾 Overview

A full-featured Tinder clone built with React Native. This app includes core dating features like swiping, matching, and messaging — all wrapped in a clean mobile UI.

The app contains four main screens: Explore, Matches, Messages, and Profile. Components like `CardItem` and `Message` are designed to be reusable, and the UI is built from scratch without any UI frameworks.

> Built as a learning project and starter template for mobile dating apps.
